# Botium Toys Internal Security Audit - README

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Internal Security Audit for **Botium Toys**, a fictional company specializing in children's products. The audit was conducted with a focus on identifying security gaps, assessing current controls, and ensuring compliance with critical industry standards. The primary goal was to enhance Botium Toys' security posture by recommending actionable improvements to safeguard sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance.

## Objective
The internal audit aimed to:
1. Assess the existing security controls at Botium Toys.
2. Evaluate compliance with industry-standard regulations such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 1/SOC 2.
3. Provide recommendations to mitigate risks and improve the companyâ€™s overall cybersecurity framework.

## Scope
The audit covered multiple layers of security controls, categorized into:
- **Access Control**: Evaluating policies like Least Privilege and Separation of Duties.
- **Network Security**: Assessing the presence of Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
- **Data Security**: Focus on Encryption, Password Management, and Backup Procedures.
- **Physical Security**: Inspection of physical controls such as CCTV Surveillance and Locks.
- **Disaster Preparedness**: Review of Disaster Recovery Plans.

## Controls Checklist Summary
A comprehensive **Controls Assessment Checklist** was developed to identify which security measures are currently in place.

### Key Control Gaps:
- Least Privilege and Separation of Duties are not enforced, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
- Lack of Disaster Recovery Plans and Encryption poses a major threat to data availability and confidentiality.
- Absence of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leaves Botium Toys vulnerable to external attacks.

## Compliance Checklist Summary
To ensure adherence to international regulations, a **Compliance Checklist** was used to review Botium Toys' alignment with:
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **System and Organization Controls (SOC 1, SOC 2)**

### Key Compliance Gaps:
- **PCI DSS**: Lack of secure environments for credit card processing.
- **GDPR**: Absence of breach notification processes and customer data privacy measures.
- **SOC 1/SOC 2**: Policies for data classification and privacy need strengthening.

## Recommendations
To improve the security posture of Botium Toys and mitigate risks, the following key recommendations are proposed:
1. **Implement Least Privilege and Separation of Duties**: These access control policies should be enforced to reduce the risk of internal threats and unauthorized access.
2. **Establish a Disaster Recovery Plan**: A formalized disaster recovery procedure will ensure business continuity in case of system failures or security incidents.
3. **Adopt Encryption Protocols**: Encrypt sensitive data, especially customer credit card information and personally identifiable information (PII), to comply with PCI DSS and GDPR.
4. **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: An IDS will help monitor network traffic and detect potential breaches in real-time.
5. **Enhance Password Management**: Introduce a robust password management system that supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced account security.
6. **Strengthen Compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR**: Immediate action is required to secure payment processing systems and ensure data privacy for EU customers.

## Conclusion
This internal security audit revealed significant areas for improvement in both security controls and regulatory compliance. By implementing the recommended security controls and aligning with compliance standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 1/SOC 2, Botium Toys can significantly enhance its security framework, protect customer data, and reduce risks to its critical assets.

This project showcases a well-rounded approach to conducting a security audit, highlighting key cybersecurity principles such as risk assessment, compliance evaluation, and security controls optimization.
